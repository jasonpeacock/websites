      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><em>Inspired by & blatantly copied from <a href=
      "https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/22/slash-office-hours/">Robert
      Heaton’s /office-hours</a>.</em></p>
      <p>I’m going to start holding weekly Office Hours for people who want
      to get better at computer programming. These will be sessions of up to
      an hour over Skype where I’ll try to answer your questions and help you
      over any stumbling blocks you’ve hit in your projects or learning.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="why-should-you-sign-up" class="level2">
      <h2>Why should you sign up?</h2>
      <p>I think that these sessions will be most useful for “Advanced
      Beginners” - people who have grasped the basic fundamentals of writing
      and running code, and are now trying to make the leap to designing and
      building more complex programs. But regardless of what stage you are
      at, if you think that spending some time talking about programming
      would be useful then I’d love to hear from you.</p>
      <p>We can cover any topic that you like. Some example things I think I
      could help with include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A specific concept doesn’t make sense and you’d like to talk it
        over</li>
        <li>You’re working on a project, you’re stuck, and you’d like to get
        unstuck</li>
        <li>You’re trying to decide what to learn about or work on next</li>
        <li>You’d like to review the code of one of your projects</li>
        <li>You just want to talk about programming</li>
        <li>The sky’s the limit</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>If you’re a member of a group that is underrepresented in the
      technology industry then I especially encourage you to get in
      touch.</em></p>

    <section id="how-do-you-sign-up" class="level2">
      <h2>How do you sign up?</h2>
      <p>Send me an email at <a href=
      "mailto:jason@jasonpeacock.com">jason@jasonpeacock.com</a> with a few
      sentences on who you are and what you’d like to work on. I’ll email you
      right back with whether I think I can help, and we can get
      scheduling.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="who-am-i" class="level2">
      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I’m a software engineer at Amazon, where I’ve worked since 2000. I
      have built metrics & monitoring systems, distributed web services,
      robot sensors, and build systems.</p>
      <p>At one point or another I’ve been proficient in C++, Java, Perl,
      Ruby, and Python; I’m currently learning Rust. I’m comfortable with
      Docker and ROS.</p>
