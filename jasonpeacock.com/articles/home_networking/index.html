<h2>Go Professional</h2>
<p>If your home networking needs are simple<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A single WIFI router provides full coverage and you only need a single WIFI network/SSID.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, get a <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-router/">consumer wireless router</a>. But if you need more from your home network, don’t settle for consumer networking equipment.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to use professional networking equipment. Unfortunately, small-business networking equipment like <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business.html">Cisco</a> or <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/">Aruba</a> are too expensive for most homes, but <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/">Ubiquiti</a> is reasonably priced and provides all the features you need for your home network.</p>

<h2>My Setup</h2>
<section id="requirements" class="level3">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>I have a number of requirements beyond simple home networking. Primarily, a single WIFI router does not provide full coverage for my house: I have a ranch-style home that is very long<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">120 feet!<br />
<br />
</span></span>; there is no central location for a WIFI router that provides a strong signal everywhere. Most frustratingly, the signal was weakest in the garage (my workshop) and the master bedroom, and there was no signal at all in the yard.</p>
<p>At the same time, with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), I now have multiple Amazon Echos &amp; Dash buttons, Sonos speakers, <a href="https://www.electricobjects.com/">digital art frame</a>, <a href="https://www.ambientweather.com/amws1000wifi.html">weather station</a>, <a href="https://www.purpleair.com/sensors">air quality monitor</a>, Raspberry Pis, smart TVs, and more. Because IoT devices are infamous for their <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iot+security+attacks">poor network security</a> I want them on their own network, segregated from my primary home network.</p>
<p>I attempted to solve these issues with consumer equipment - I tried (multiple times) using an older WIFI router configured as an access point to extend the range, but configuration was difficult and error prone. I tried using WIFI range extenders, but they were just as flaky and difficult to configure. I tried configuring multiple SSIDs and controlling their access in the router, but again configuration was difficult.</p>
<p>I was tired of trying, I wanted a professional solution that just worked.</p>
