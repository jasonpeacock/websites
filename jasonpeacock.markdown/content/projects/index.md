<!--
[The Autobroom!](auto-broom)
:    I needed to clean my roof. 24hrs later, I had something that worked as designed and my roof still needed cleaning.

[Bottleshaker](bottleshaker)
:    Making carbonated water at home is simple, but tedious -- so I attempted to automate it.

[Chiminea](chiminea)
:    Practicing my welding and fabrication by building a chiminea for a friend.

[Garden Shed](garden-shed)
:    Get the yard tools out of the garage and make use of an awkward corner of my property.
