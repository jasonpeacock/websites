## About

If you're a software developer and would like to chat, I have [office hours](/office-hours).

I have a powerboat, [Walrus](/boating/walrus), that I cruise with in the PNW.

I maintain an [led-bargraph library](/software/led-bargraph) for Rust, including a [driver for the HT16K33 chip](/software/ht16k33).

## Highlights

### January, 2019

I hacked together a [silent "Ring Bell for Service" doorbell sign](projects/silent-ring-bell-for-service) for my open-office desk-space at work.
