## Introduction

I have [office hours](office-hours) if you're a software developer and would like to chat about your career, the industry, interviewing, or other challenges.

I have a powerboat, [Walrus](boating/walrus), that I cruise with in the PNW.

I maintain an [led-bargraph library](software/led-bargraph) for Rust, including a [driver for the HT16K33 chip](software/ht16k33).

## Highlights

### January, 2019

How I build my websites [using markdown](projects/markdown-websites).

I hacked together a [silent "Ring Bell for Service" doorbell sign](projects/silent-ring-bell-for-service) for my open-office desk-space at work.
