## About

If you're a software developer and would like to chat, I have [office hours](/office-hours).

I talk a bit about my [home networking](/articles/home-networking) setup. It's not too fancy, but it's better than the default cable modem + WIFI router setup.

I have a boat, named [Walrus](/boating/walrus), that I cruise with in the PNW.

I maintain an [led-bargraph library](/software/led-bargraph) for Rust, including a [driver for the HT16K33 chip](/software/ht16k33).
