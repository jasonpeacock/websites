# How small is your change?


-----
1. Overview of how most teams end up doing development during sprints and the pitfalls: code all sprint and test/review/deploy in a "big bang" at the end of the sprint...or not, and have it be late. Many times CRs are pushed through with follow-up tasks added to the backlog to cleanup things that there wasn't time "to do right"...and we know those backlog items never get done.

-----
1. The advantages of incremental development and release throughout the sprint. Constant feedback, always have a working version, requires more thought before starting. Smaller changes are faster to review, easier to understand, quicker to fix.

-----
1. What it looks like in practice and how to implement for your team.

-----
1. Exercises to challenge current paradigms and find what fits best for your team. E.g. force everyone to review/commit at the end of each day for a sprint and then talk about the experience in the retrospective.

# Code

When also using [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) integration, code blocks in Markdown
are converted to HTML first, then colored by Highlight.js:

// `init` API function that initializes (and runs) the presentation.
var init = function () {
if (initialized) { return; }
execPreInitPlugins();

// First we set up the viewport for mobile devices.
// For some reason iPad goes nuts when it is not done properly.
var meta = $("meta[name='viewport']") || document.createElement("meta");
meta.content = "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no";
if (meta.parentNode !== document.head) {
meta.name = 'viewport';
document.head.appendChild(meta);
}

# Slide separator

* 5 dashes are used to separate slides:

`-----`

* Attributes from `div.step` element are simply repeated.
* Better use relative positioning, lest your slides will all be on top of each other.
* If you need to set some attributes, just use HTML and create a div element, then write
Markdown inside each div.
