## Introduction

A Rust driver for the [*Holtek HT16K33 "RAM Mapping 16\*8 LED Controller Driver with keyscan"*](http://www.holtek.com/productdetail/-/vg/HT16K33). The driver follows the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) implementation for Rust hardware abstraction.

Available on [Github](https://github.com/jasonpeacock/ht16k33) and [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ht16k33) as `ht16k33`.

The driver is part of the [`led-bargraph`](../led-bargraph/) project, a Rust library & application for the [Adafruit Bi-Color (Red/Green) 24-Bar Bargraph w/I2C Backpack Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1721).
