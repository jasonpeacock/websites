I'm going to start holding weekly Office Hours for people who want to get better at computer programming.
These will be sessions of up to an hour over Skype where I'll try to answer your questions and help you
over any stumbling blocks you've hit in your projects or learning.

## Why should you sign up?

I think that these sessions will be most useful for "Advanced Beginners" - people who have grasped the basic
fundamentals of writing and running code, and are now trying to make the leap to designing and building more
complex programs. But regardless of what stage you are at, if you think that spending some time talking about
programming would be useful then I'd love to hear from you.

We can cover any topic that you like. Some example things I think I could help with include:

* A specific concept doesn't make sense and you'd like to talk it over
* You're working on a project, you're stuck, and you'd like to get unstuck
* You're trying to decide what to learn about or work on next
* You'd like to review the code of one of your projects
* You just want to talk about programming
* The sky's the limit

*If you're a member of a group that is underrepresented in the technology industry then I especially encourage
you to get in touch.*

## How do you sign up?

Send me an email at [jason@jasonpeacock.com](mailto:jason@jasonpeacock.com) with a few sentences on who you are
and what you'd like to work on. I'll email you right back with whether I think I can help, and we can get scheduling.

## Who am I?

Iâ€™m a software engineer at Amazon, where I've worked since 2000. I have built metrics & monitoring systems, distributed web services, robot sensors, and build systems.

At one point or another I've been proficient in C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, and Python; I'm currently learning Rust. I'm comfortable with Docker and ROS.
